What is Constructor?
When new Keyword creates an objcet, Constructor just initilizes the state of an Object.
A Constructor is spacial Method that is used to initilize the Object to some default value at the time of Object creation.
If no user-defined constructor is provided for a class, class will have Default constructor,
and compiler initilizes the member variable to deafult values.

1) numeric data types are set to 0
2) char data types are set to null character(‘\0’)
3) reference variables are set to null


Rules for creating constructor
https://www.codejava.net/java-core/the-java-language/9-rules-about-constructors-in-java
1)It has same name as the class.
2)It should not return value(No Return Type) not even void.
3)Declaring constructors is not required.If we write class compiler creates Default NoArg Constructor.
4)Compiler won't generate the default noArg constructor if there is already constructor present in class
5)If we are writing Parametrised constructor then to get No-Arg constructor you need to explicitly write it.
    Note - Only in case if you need access No-Arg constructor you need to write it on else no need to write.
6)Constructor doesn't get inherit from parents to child infact during inheritance constructor chaining happens.
    i.e. During child Object creation constructor of child class calls constructor of parent class executes
    whatever there in parent class and then again comes back to child class constructor and proceed.
7)Default constructor has same Access modifier as that of class
8)First statement of constructor must be this() or super();
