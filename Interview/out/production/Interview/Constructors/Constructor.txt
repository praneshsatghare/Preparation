What is Constructor?
When new Keyword creates an objcet, Costructor just initilizes the state of an Object.
A Constructor is spacial Method that is used to initilize the Object to some default value at the time of Object creation.
If no user-defined constructor is provided for a class, class will have Default constructor,
and compiler initilizes the member variable to deafult values.

1) numeric data types are set to 0
2) char data types are set to null character(‘\0’)
3) reference variables are set to null


Rules for creating constructor
1)It has same name as the class.
2)It should not return value not even void.
3)If we are writing Parametrised constructor then to get No-Arg constructor you need to explicitly write it.
    Note - Only in case if you need access No-Arg constructor you need to write it on else no need to write.
